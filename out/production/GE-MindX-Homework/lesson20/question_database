Question 1. What is database index? How is it implemented under the hood?
=> Index is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations
=> Index creates 1 data structure that allows mapping value of a specified property to the record's address
=> when query to get data. it gets addresses from index table first then it use those addresses to get record

It was implemented by one of the kinds
1. HashTable => store pairs of value and address using key - value
2. B+Tree, B Tree => self-balanced tree
3. SSTables index => apache casandra

Question 2. Why don’t we index every columns to support fast read?

1. index uses memory to store data => increasing cost for storing
2. When insert data, they are stored both index area and their data area => affect to performance when insert data
3. There might be fields that don't use as inputs of queries. Don't need to mark index

Question 3. How does Hash Indexes work? What is its disadvantages?
1. Hash indexes  uses the data structure named HashTable, it stores key-value. key is hash code of index column, values is corresponding record's address
2. Disadvantages
- be only useful for exact look for
- doesn't support range value, unequal condition (> , < , >=, <=)
- Hash index don't support partial key matching if create index on 2 colum c1, c1. it is not working if query by only c1 or c2
- Be unstable by hashtable collision

Question 4. Compare B+Tree and B-Tree
1. B+Tree
=> just store pointer to record ad leaf node
=> Leaf nodes are connected 2-ways (looks like a Doubly Linked List)
=> duplicate key between level of key

2. B Tree
=> Store pointer to record both inner node and leaf node
=> leaf-node are not connected
=> No duplicate key between level of key

Question 5. Why use B+Tree for index, not BST/AVL/Red-Black Tree

1. in terms of comparing B+Tree <=> BST
B+Tree is self-balanced tree, BST is not => B+Tree's performance is stable

2. when it comes to comparing B+Tree <=> Red-Black Tree(self-balancing binary search tree)
- each node of Red-Black Tree store only item => is worse when want to get the continuous values
- Red-Black Tree doesn't connect leaf node like B+Tree => is worse when want to get a range of value
==> B+Tree is most effective if you want to look up by a range

6. What is B+Tree indexes ’s disadvantage?
=> implement more complicated than hash Tree
=> when query exactly the performance is less than Hash Tree , Hash Tree (O(1)), B+Tree (Log(N))

7. given B+Tree index (C1, C2, C3), can B+Tree support query on C2?
=> B+Tree doesn't support query on C2
=> the key value was concatenate c1, c2, c3. have to query by a correct order. examples: c1; (c1, c2), (c1, c2, c3)

8. Compare B+Tree index and Hash index?
=> B+Tree:
 - self-balanced tree => performance is stable
 - time complexity 0(log(n))
 - Allows Matching leftmost prefix: if create index (Col1, Col2, Col3) => B+Tree index can support query on (Col1)
 - support for query by condition value ( >, < , >=, <=)
 - support query by range
=>  Hash index
- Hash table => performance is unstable => worst case time O(n)
- time complexity average 0(log(n))
- doesn't support leftmost prefix
- just allows query exactly, doesn't support condition value
- doesn't support query by a range

9. What happens to index when database machine crashes?
=> Database use write ahead log (WAL) to store modifications before update to B+Tree
=> when database comes back after crash, B+Tree was load from log

10. What are diff between clustered index and non-clustered index.
=> clustered index
- The index that defines the order that was used to store data on disk (it's primary key as usual)
- there is only one clustered index.

=> non-clustered index
- create a new data area to store data key - value between has code of column to the address of row
- can have multiple non-clustered indexes.

11. Should we index boolean column?
- should not create index boolean column
- in terms of "Selectivity" value
selectivity = the number of distinct value / the number of rows
for index boolean type.=> the number of distinct value = 2
=> selectivity ~0
=> when query it still scan all rows event it crate index for boolean column
